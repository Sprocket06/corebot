# Corebot
## Written for the Fatal Core community by Sprocket
This is a personal project of mine, and not intended for self-hosting. If you run a Fatal Core related server and want the bot in your own server, talk to me on discord @Sprocket#0781. Some parts of the bot will not be public (card data, art, etc.) as they are provided to me by the Fatal Core team or taken from the source code and are not mine.
No clue what Fatal Core is? It's a super cool online card game, check it out [here](https://fatalcoretcg.com), and join the [official Fatal Core discord](https://discord.gg/augzm4n).
